## STRX系统

* STRX是TRON CANADA推出的建立在TRON公链上的社区平台，TRONCanada团队会在STRX平台开发自己的DAPP，根据投票记录空投给每一位投票人，50%出块奖励会按比例分红给各投票人。

* 根据大量调研准备，STRX年回报率超过100%。持有STRX会享有所有基于STRX平台优质项目的种子轮投资权，并且会按月获得TRX分红回报。

* 无论以哪种方式支持TRONCanada，您都会按比例得到STRX空投，例如给TRON CANADA投10000trx票，就能获得等额10000STRX代币。TRONCanada当选超级节点后，TRON CANADA基金会将会按比例分红TRX出块奖励给所有持有STRX的社区成员。

## TRON Canada Community Plan：

TRON Canada believes in a Tron ecosystem that is driven by the community for the good of the community, instead of ruled by select groups or individuals. We strongly believe TRON will attract the best talent in the blockchain community, empowering the TRON community to grow, and eventually thrive. In support of this, we propose that should we be elected as a block producer, 30% of our block rewards will be contributed in support of projects that highlight the potential of TRON, thereby helping to support the creation of a diverse dApp (Distributed Application) ecosystem on the TRON blockchain.

We will cooperate with blockchain@UBC, in order to approach the best academic resources of blockchain. For the People who did a great job helping with translation to successfully bridge the discussion between Chinese and overseas Block Producer communities, we will airdrop TRON Canada token for all community contributors. We also recognize the vital role public outreach and education plays in bringing any technology to mainstream adoption, and as such we’ve built strong ties within the local community and beyond, tirelessly advocating and educating through meetups, social media and community forums.
