TRON Canada believes in a Tron ecosystem that is driven by the community for the good of the community, instead of ruled by select groups or individuals. We strongly believe TRON will attract the best talent in the blockchain community, empowering the TRON community to grow, and eventually thrive. In support of this, we propose that should we be elected as a block producer, 30% of our block rewards will be contributed in support of projects that highlight the potential of TRON, thereby helping to support the creation of a diverse dApp (Distributed Application) ecosystem on the TRON blockchain.

We will cooperate with blockchain@UBC, in order to approach the best academic resources of blockchain. For the People who did a great job helping with translation to successfully bridge the discussion between Chinese and overseas Block Producer communities, we will airdrop TRON Canada token for all community contributors. We also recognize the vital role public outreach and education plays in bringing any technology to mainstream adoption, and as such weâ€™ve built strong ties within the local community and beyond, tirelessly advocating and educating through meetups, social media and community forums.
